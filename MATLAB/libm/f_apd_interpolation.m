% [s] - input signal.
%
% [Par] - parameters characterizing the signal and demodulation procedure. This is a
%         variable of the structure type. Its fields are as follows:
%
%         .Nr - numbers of sample points on the refined uniform grid used for
%               interpolating nonuniformly sampled signals. This is an array of D
%               elements.
%
% [Ub] - array with the upper bound constraints on the modulator. This array must be
%        empty or have the same number of elements as the input signal array, s.
%
% [t] - sampling coordinates. This is a real 2D array, with the number of rows equal
%       to the number of signal sample points, and the number of columns equal to the
%       dimension of the input signal.
%
%
% O U T P U T   A R G U M E N T S
%
% [out_s] - interpolated signal.
%
% [out_Ub] - interpolated upper bounds on the modulator.
%
% [out_ix] - linear indexes of the elements of an interpolated signal corresponding
%            to every element of the original signal, i.e., mapping between the
%            linear indexes of the original and interpolated signals.
